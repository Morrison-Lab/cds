The cost of an algorithm depends on the size \\n\\ of its input. Asymptotic notation compares how two costs grow as \\n\\ grows, ignoring constant factors and small inputs.

## 1 Upper, lower and tight bounds

>
> That is, \\f\\ grows no faster than a constant multiple of \\g\\ once \\n\\ is large enough. This is the definition of Arora and Barak ([2009, sec. 0.3](#ref-arora2009computational)).

> **Definition 3 (Big-Theta notation)** For \\f\\ and \\g\\ as in [Definition 1](#def-big-o), we write \\f(n) = \Theta(g(n))\\ if both \\f(n) = O(g(n))\\ ([Definition 1](#def-big-o)) and \\f(n) = \Omega(g(n))\\ ([Definition 2](#def-big-omega)). Then \\f\\ and \\g\\ grow at the same rate, up to constant factors.

> **NOTE:**

> *Remark 1* (The equals sign is one-way). \\O(g(n))\\ stands for a set of functions, and \\f(n) = O(g(n))\\ says that \\f\\ belongs to it. So \\n = O(n^2)\\ is true, but \\n^2 = O(n)\\ is false, and the statement cannot be read from right to left. Cormen et al. ([2009, sec. 3.1](#ref-cormen2009introduction)) reads the notation this way.

## 2 Examples

> **NOTE:**
>
> **Example 1 (A quadratic is \\O(n^2)\\ but not \\O(n)\\)** Let \\f(n) = 3n^2 + 5n\\.
>
> For \\n \ge 5\\, we have \\5n \le n \cdot n = n^2\\, so
>
> \\ \begin{aligned} f(n) &= 3n^2 + 5n \\ &\le 3n^2 + n^2 \\ &= 4n^2. \end{aligned} \\
>
> So \\f(n) = O(n^2)\\, with \\c = 4\\ and \\n_0 = 5\\ in [Definition 1](#def-big-o). Since \\f(n) \ge 3n^2\\ for every \\n\\, also \\f(n) = \Omega(n^2)\\ ([Definition 2](#def-big-omega)), and so \\f(n) = \Theta(n^2)\\ ([Definition 3](#def-big-theta)).
>
> But \\f(n)\\ is not \\O(n)\\. If it were, there would be \\c \> 0\\ and \\n_0\\ with \\3n^2 + 5n \le c \\ n\\ for every \\n \ge n_0\\. Dividing both sides by \\n \> 0\\ gives \\3n + 5 \le c\\ for every \\n \ge n_0\\, which fails for any \\n\\ larger than both \\n_0\\ and \\(c - 5)/3\\.

> **Example 2 (Counting the operations in an inner product)** The inner product of two vectors \\\mathord{\smash\[b\]{\underset{\raise.3ex\hbox{\$\scriptstyle\sim\$}}{x}}\vphantom{x}}, \mathord{\smash\[b\]{\underset{\raise.3ex\hbox{\$\scriptstyle\sim\$}}{z}}\vphantom{z}}\in \mathbb{R}^D\\ is
>
> \\\mathord{\smash\[b\]{\underset{\raise.3ex\hbox{\$\scriptstyle\sim\$}}{x}}\vphantom{x}}^\top \mathord{\smash\[b\]{\underset{\raise.3ex\hbox{\$\scriptstyle\sim\$}}{z}}\vphantom{z}}= x_1 z_1 + x_2 z_2 + \cdots + x_D z_D.\\
>
> Computing it takes \\D\\ multiplications, one for each product \\x_d z_d\\, and \\D - 1\\ additions to sum the \\D\\ products: \\2D - 1\\ arithmetic operations in all. Since \\2D - 1 \le 2D\\ for every \\D \ge 1\\, the cost is \\O(D)\\, with \\D\\ in the role of \\n\\, \\c = 2\\ and \\n_0 = 1\\ in [Definition 1](#def-big-o). Since \\2D - 1 \ge D\\ for every \\D \ge 1\\, it is also \\\Omega(D)\\ ([Definition 2](#def-big-omega)), so it is \\\Theta(D)\\ ([Definition 3](#def-big-theta)). When a machine learning text says an inner product “costs \\O(D)\\”, it means this count of operations, up to a constant factor.
